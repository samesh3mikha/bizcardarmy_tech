	<h4>How are business cards organized in the iphone app?</h4>
  	<p>The cards are basically categorized as pending, completed and unpaid. When you upload a card, its status is 'pending'. If you don't have credits for payment, 
	the cards you upload are marked as 'unpaid' and are not processed until payment is done. Once the cards have been transcribed, it is 'completed'. 
	Also, you can sort you cards using different options like name, company, created date etc.</p>
